                <p class="about">At Panea, food isn’t just a meal — it’s an experience,a story, a connection.
                    Born from a love of fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and warm hospitality,
                    Panea was created to bring people together around the table, just like family.
                    What started as a dream in a humble kitchen has grown into a vibrant space
                    where tradition meets innovation. Our menu is inspired by timeless recipes
                    and reimagined with a modern twist — always fresh, always made with love
                    Whether you’re here for a casual bite or a special celebration, our goal is
                    the same: to make you feel at home. From the first hello to the last bite,
                    every detail is designed to delight.

                    We believe great food can spark conversations, create memories, and build
                    community — and at Panea, we invite you to be a part of that story.


                    Welcome to Panea.</p>

                    <p class="paragph">lorem ipsum Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
                        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
                        over 2000 years
                        old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                        source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                        Malorum"
                        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                        theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                        "Lorem
                        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard 
                        chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
                        Sections 1.10.32
                        and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
                        exact original
                        form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. </p>
